## Client
The OPNsense Cert Warden Client Plugin is a plugin that allows the easy
obtaining, updating, and use of certificates that are managed by a
Cert Warden instance.

### Building

On a FreeBSD 14.2 system, clone the repo and run `make` in the `/plugin`
directory.

Note: This is not the standard way to build OPNsense packages, but it
gets the job done and fast.
